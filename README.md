## Architecture
![architecture](https://github.com/mullaa/EC601_miniproject/blob/master/Architecture.png)

## Instruction
The main file is COSMATTER.py, and make sure you have extract_tweet.py, sentiment_text_analysis.py and MyFirstProject.json in the same folder with the main file.

If all goes well, you just need to open the terminal in the current directory and type in "export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="MyFirstProject.json"" first, and then "python COSMATTER.py", like this:
![terminal](terminal.png)

A window like this will pop up, asking about the number of tweets you want to extract. In this example, we type in 100:
![GetNum](GetNum.png)

Then another window will pop up, asking about the Hashtag you want to scrape. In this case, we type in tomford:
![GetHashtag](GetHashtag.png)

Allowing a few seconds to process and you will see the result like this:
![result](Result.png)

Feel free to try on different cosmetics brands :)
Users can know if this brand is popular and the degree of popularity.


## Interface
[PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)

We choose to use PyQt5 to build a simple interface. PyQt5 is easy to learn and mutifunctional.

## APIs
[Twitter APIs](https://dev.twitter.com/)

After passing the Twitter APIs application, we get the keys to access to Twitter. Before we can actually use Twitter APIs, we need to first create an app as part of their OAuth authorization scheme, then set up a development environment for the endpoint. There are many libraries which Twitter provided that support the standard Twitter API. We prefer Tweepy for its convenience and multifunction.

[Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/)

After installing Tweepy, we just need to create an api object and well use it to obtain the related tweets we want. In this case, we use Tweepy's Cursor to crawl down tweets with specific cosmetics hashtag keywordï¼Œ and aggregate them in a .txt file waiting for furthrt analysis.

[Google Natural Language APIs](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/)

Our goal of this app is to get the sentiment from texts(conments from Twitter), so we use the analysissentiment function. In this function, we transmit a string parameter to the function, then it will be decoded and analysised by analysissentiment function. Steps are shown as follow:

First, we should create a google cloud account. We have a project and I am the owner of this project. Then download json file from Google cloud to the computer and get the key.

Second, set the environment before running the program. use "export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=[PATH of json file]".

Third, use data from Twitter as the parameter as the program and analysis them. Finally, we get the result: score and magnitude.

The program use client.analyze_sentiment() function to analyse the sentiment to send the request and anayse the document by using request.document_sentiment.

For example, we want to check Becca's popularity:

![example](https://github.com/mullaa/EC601_miniproject/blob/master/becca.png)

We can get two results: score and magnitude.
Documentsentiment includes whole sentiment of a document, it has two indexes. Score is from -1 to 1. -1 represents negative and 1 represents positive, which shows the sentiment orientation. Magnitude represents the intensity of this sentiment.
![beccasentiment](https://github.com/mullaa/EC601_miniproject/blob/master/Becca_sentiment.png)
In this example, score = 0.4 and magnitude = 88 Compared with other brands, the sentiment is obvious positive. So Becca has high popularity.

## Lessons learned

### What you liked doing? 
We like to do the programming for using API and write the front-end interface. We feel so excited when we extract the data and get the results of analyzing the data. After finishing the design of interface, we learnt how to write the front-end by python, which is a new skill.

### What you could have done better?
For analysing by google API, we can classify the different sentiments and do a more clear degree analysis, which is more user-friendly for users. In addition, we can write a judging function and decide if this brand should be bought and tell customers a direct result, for example, buy or not. If we do this, there will be different but suitable results for different users.

### What you will avoid in the future?
First, if we use the large API request, the security and convenience are very important, we should upgraded the time to optimize the API requests. Second, ports of API should have good readability and scalability, or leave some interface functions for future.
